%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

This plugin allows you to enforce a certain policy for topic names by defining
a set of rules. Each rule consists of 

   1 a regular expression pattern
   1 an error message, and
   1 a flag

When a topic is to be edited or saved, the regular expressions are checked. Each
rule can be flagged =deny= or =allow. All rules are processed in the order given.
The first pattern that matches either forbids or allows the topic to be processed
any further. For instance, the example only allows topics names to consist of 
characters a-z, A-Z, digits 0-9, the dot and a slash. Dot and slash are needed
as the match is tested against the fully qualified topic name consisting of the
web and topic part, separated by a dot. That way you can create different rules for
different webs.

Several topics can be specified using
<noautolink>

   * Set TOPICVALIDATION_PLUGIN_RULESET = TopicNameRuleSet1, TopicNameRuleSet1, ...

</noautolink>
(defaults to %SYSTEMWEB%.TopicNameValidationPlugin)

Each ruleset topic is parsed for a table in the format given below and all rules
are concatenated.

If a topic name is forbidden, the user is redirected to =oopstopicname=. That's
where the =error message= is inserted as specified in the second column of the
rule set.

A rule can be disabled temporarily by adding =disabled= to the third column.


| *Pattern* | *Message* | *Flag* |
| [^a-zA-Z0-9\.\/_] | Only characters a-z and digits 0-9 are allowed. | |
